webexploit-shell

This core mechanism of this challenge is accessing shell commands from GET url arguments. The argument
value for 'file' is unsafely concat'd with a 'cat' command to create a command string, which prints the
output of files. From this, the solver can include shell commands via shell injection and gain access
to the directory.
