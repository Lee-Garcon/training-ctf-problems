This directory is for projects that have to do with CTF. Most of these projects will be CTF problems that I thought will be 
interesting to present to other people to solve. Each challenge directory will have a README that will explain the core concepts
of the CTF challenge, and how to solve it. At its finest, a CTF challenge is a well-crafted puzzle that demands from its solvers
and I think it will be fun to create my own CTF challenges that could challenge (and train) other people. 

Each flag is in the form of 'FILE_' and then random strings. There are no spaces within a flag; all 'spaces' are replaced with
underscores. Try to figure out the solution to the challenges without looking at the READMEs first, then if you are stuck check
them to get the solution :)

To run a web exploit challenge, run the python script 'run.py' located within the directory.

Happy solving!
