This directory is for projects that have to do with CTF. Most of these projects will be CTF problems that I thought will be 
interesting to present to other people to solve. Each challenge directory will have a README that will explain the core concepts
of the CTF challenge, and how to solve it. At its finest, a CTF challenge is a well-crafted puzzle that demands from its solvers
and I think it will be fun to create my own CTF challenges that could challenge (and train) other people. 

Each flag is in the form of 'FILE_' and then random strings. There are no spaces within a flag; all 'spaces' are replaced with
underscores.

To run a web exploit challenge, run the python script 'run.py' located within the directory.

Happy solving!
